*Not everything you can set is documented here; if you're an advanced user we advise you take a look at the included [configschema.json](configschema.json) file.*

This bundle heavily relies on the [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) plugin, so make sure you have this installed (custom address/port and password can be specified in the bundle's config if needed).
